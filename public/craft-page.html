    <p>January 5, 2024 - It's a new year and I need a new project. I am deciding between a crochet-along blanket that uses random yarns you already have and buying some lovely bamboo yarn to make a sweater. OR I could unravel an ugly sweater I have and make a new one. I've never tried re-using yarn before. Maybe I should start a quick project in the meantime since I can't decide.</p>
